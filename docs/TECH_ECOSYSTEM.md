## Basic Building Blocks
### Rust and Anchor
Solana supports writing on-chain programs using the Rust programming language.
Anchor is a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several convenient developer tools for writing smart contracts.
### Typescript
When we created this project using the Anchor framework, it generated a tests/programs.ts file. So we use typescript to write test file for contract.
